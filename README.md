In this To Do list we can add our task list and mark that task as completed or incomplete. We can also click on close icon to delete the particular task from the ToDo list.

I'm using Local Storage that will store the task list or To Do list in the web browser, So that if we close and restart the browser then also it will display your saved To-Do List
